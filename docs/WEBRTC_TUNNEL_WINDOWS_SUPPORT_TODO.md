### Non-negotiable implementation rules

- Do not fork the codebase for Windows.
- Do not add `#[cfg(unix)]`, `#[cfg(windows)]`, or `#[cfg(target_os = ...)]` for
  permission or home-directory concerns anywhere above `p2p-platform`.
- Do not change signaling wire format, identity format, crypto, forward semantics, or
  WebRTC architecture.
- Do not relax the fail-closed security knobs in `AppConfig::validate` to accommodate
  Windows.
- Do not make a platform return `Ok(())` from a security check it cannot actually enforce.
  Report the gap via `ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS`.
- Do not add `unsafe` to `p2p-platform` without explicit sign-off recorded in this file;
  the workspace sets `unsafe_code = "forbid"` and `p2p-mobile` is its only documented
  exception.
- Do not put tunnel logic in `p2p-service-windows`. It is SCM plumbing only.
- Do not make `ctrl_c()` the service stop path. The SCM sends control codes, not console
  signals.
- Do not fix Android host-portability test failures by changing Android app behavior.
- Do not run the Docker broker E2E on `windows-latest`.
- Do not suppress lint findings to make a gate pass. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- Run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` before marking any task complete.

### Priority definitions

```text
P0 = required for a correct, secure Windows service deployment
P1 = validation and integration work after P0 is correct
P2 = packaging and release-matrix work
```

### Recording decisions

Two open policy questions are called out inline as **DECISION REQUIRED**. Do not
implement past them without sign-off; record the answer in this file when given.

# P0 tasks

## P0-001 — Extract the `p2p-platform` OS seam — **DONE**

### Files
```text
crates/p2p-platform/                    (new)
Cargo.toml
crates/p2p-core/Cargo.toml
crates/p2p-core/src/config/paths.rs
```

### Goal
Create the single OS seam crate and move `p2p-core`'s home-directory and world-writable
logic behind it.

### Status
Complete. `home_dir()`, `ensure_private_file_permissions()`,
`ensure_not_writable_by_others()`, and `ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS` exist with unix and
windows implementations. `p2p-core/src/config/paths.rs` delegates instead of carrying its
own `cfg` pair.

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] `p2p-core` contains no `#[cfg(unix)]` for permissions or home resolution.
- [x] `home_dir()` prefers `USERPROFILE` on Windows and falls back to `HOME`.
- [x] `cargo test -p p2p-platform -p p2p-core` passes on Windows.

---

## P0-002 — Test-fixture portability — **DONE**

### Files
```text
crates/p2p-core/src/config/tests/support.rs
crates/p2p-core/src/config/tests/loading.rs
crates/p2p-core/src/config/tests/data_plane.rs
crates/p2p-core/tests/config_parsing.rs
crates/p2p-mobile/src/runtime/tests.rs
crates/p2p-mobile/tests/tracing_install_failure.rs
bins/p2pctl/src/commands/tests.rs
```

### Goal
Fixtures that hand-build TOML embedded raw `Path::display()` output. On Windows those are
backslashes, and TOML basic strings read `\U` as an 8-digit unicode escape, so configs
failed to parse.

### Status
Complete. A `toml_path()` helper doubles backslashes at every hand-built TOML site.
`advertised_local_ipv4_invalid_is_rejected` no longer builds a directory name from the
test value `"::1"` (`:` is reserved in Windows paths).

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] 25 previously failing tests pass across `p2p-core`, `p2p-mobile`, `p2pctl`.
- [x] Production code unaffected — `identity.rs::render_toml()` never interpolates paths.

---

## P0-003 — Windows CI job — **DONE**

### Files
```text
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Status
Complete. `test-windows` runs fmt, clippy, and tests on `windows-latest` and is wired into
the `signoff` gate alongside Linux and macOS.

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] Job added and required in `signoff`.
- [ ] **Confirm green on the first real run.** It has only ever been validated on a local
      Windows machine; the hosted runner may differ. If it fails, fix forward rather than
      demoting the gate.

---

## P0-004 — Move the remaining unix-only production code behind the seam

**Depends on P0-006**, which adds `default_config_dir()`. Do that task first; the
`HOME`-replacement step below calls a function that does not exist until it lands. The
`identity.rs` and `create_private_file` parts of this task have no such dependency and can
proceed independently.

### Files
```text
crates/p2p-crypto/src/identity.rs
bins/p2pctl/src/commands.rs
bins/p2p-offer/src/main.rs
bins/p2p-answer/src/main.rs
crates/p2p-platform/src/lib.rs
crates/p2p-platform/src/unix.rs
crates/p2p-platform/src/windows.rs
```

### Goal
`p2p-crypto` and `p2pctl` still carry their own `#[cfg(unix)]` permission code and `HOME`
lookups. Move them to the seam so `p2p-platform` is genuinely the only OS-aware place.

### Recommended implementation
- Replace `identity.rs`'s `validate_private_file_permissions` pair with a call to
  `p2p_platform::ensure_private_file_permissions`, mapping `PlatformError` to
  `CryptoError::Permission`.
- Add `p2p_platform::create_private_file(path, contents)` — `0600` on unix, and on Windows
  a file created inside a directory whose DACL already restricts it (see P0-006). Use it
  for `write_identity_files` in `p2pctl`.
- Replace every `std::env::var_os("HOME")` in the three binaries and `p2pctl` with
  `p2p_platform::default_config_dir()`.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `grep -rn 'cfg(unix)' crates bins --include=*.rs` outside `p2p-platform` returns only
      test files. (The Android ICE branches use `cfg(target_os = "android")`, not
      `cfg(unix)`, so they will not appear in this grep at all — they are a separate,
      pre-existing concern and are out of scope.)
- [ ] `grep -rn 'var_os("HOME")' crates bins --include=*.rs` returns nothing outside
      `p2p-platform`.
- [ ] `p2pctl keygen` works from native PowerShell, not only Git Bash.

---

## P0-005 — Report unenforced permission checks at startup

### Files
```text
bins/p2p-offer/src/main.rs
bins/p2p-answer/src/main.rs
crates/p2p-daemon/src/logging.rs
```

### Goal
`AppConfig::validate` refuses to load a config that disables
`refuse_world_readable_identity` or `refuse_world_writable_paths`, so a user is entitled to
believe they are enforced. On Windows they currently are not.

### Recommended implementation
At daemon startup, if `!p2p_platform::ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS`, emit a single
`tracing::warn!` naming what is not enforced and what provides the protection instead
(the config directory DACL). Do not warn per-path; once per process.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Warning appears exactly once on Windows startup.
- [ ] No warning on unix.
- [ ] Wording states plainly that the check did not run, not that it passed.

---

## P0-006 — Windows config and state directory layout

**P0-004 depends on this task** for `default_config_dir()`. Consider doing it first.

### Files
```text
crates/p2p-platform/src/windows.rs
crates/p2p-platform/src/unix.rs
docs/WEBRTC_TUNNEL_WINDOWS_SUPPORT_SPEC.md  (section 6.3)
```

### Goal
Implement `default_config_dir()` per spec §6.3: `%ProgramData%\p2ptunnel\<role>\` for the
service, `%USERPROFILE%\.config\p2ptunnel\` for an interactive user.

### Recommended implementation
Select the service path when running under the service account, otherwise the user path.
Prefer an explicit `--config` argument over either; do not guess when the caller was
explicit.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Both layouts resolve correctly and are covered by unit tests.
- [ ] Unix behavior is unchanged.

---

## P0-007 — `p2p-service-windows` binary with SCM integration

### Files
```text
bins/p2p-service-windows/               (new)
crates/p2p-daemon/src/process_signal.rs
```

### Goal
Host `run_answer_daemon` / `run_offer_daemon` under the Service Control Manager, with
`SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` driving the existing `ShutdownToken`.

### Recommended implementation
- SCM registration, control handler, and `SERVICE_STATUS` reporting live only in this
  binary.
- The control handler resolves the same `ShutdownToken` the unix signal adapter produces.
  Nothing downstream of the token changes.
- Keep `ctrl_c()` as the foreground-console path; a service and a console process are two
  producers of one generic shutdown request.
- Report `SERVICE_STOP_PENDING` with a truthful wait hint while sessions drain, then
  `SERVICE_STOPPED`.

### On `unsafe_code = "forbid"`
Read this before assuming a policy exception is needed — the constraint is narrower than it
first appears.

`unsafe_code` is a **per-crate** lint. It fires on `unsafe` written in *this* crate's own
source. A dependency being full of `unsafe` internally is irrelevant, so calling a crate
like `windows-service` through its safe API trips nothing.

The one real hazard is **macro expansion**: `forbid` also fires on `unsafe` that a macro
expands into our crate, and `forbid` cannot be overridden by an inner `allow`.
`windows-service` exposes `define_windows_service!`, which generates the `extern "system"`
entry point. Whether that expansion contains `unsafe` must be **verified empirically** —
add the dependency, write the smallest possible service skeleton, and see whether it
compiles under the workspace lint.

Only if it does not compile is there a decision to make, and then the options are: a
documented `bins/p2p-service-windows` exception on the model of `p2p-mobile`, or a
different crate. Record the outcome of the experiment here either way.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Registered as two independent services per spec §6.4 (`p2ptunnel-answer`,
      `p2ptunnel-offer`), one binary with `--role`, each with its own config directory.
- [ ] `sc.exe start` / `sc.exe stop` work for each.
- [ ] Stop is graceful: exit code 0, terminal `Closed` status, no lingering listeners.
- [ ] Binary contains no tunnel logic.
- [ ] `p2p-offer` and `p2p-answer` are unchanged — no supervisor-specific mode is added to
      either, per the rule quoted in spec §6.4.

## P0-008 — Service installer: virtual account and restrictive DACL

### Files
```text
packaging/windows/                      (new)
scripts/
```

### Goal
Install the service under `NT SERVICE\p2ptunnel` and lock down the config directory.

### Recommended implementation
- Create the service with `sc.exe create ... obj= "NT SERVICE\p2ptunnel"`, which
  materializes the virtual account without password management.
- Apply a DACL to `%ProgramData%\p2ptunnel` granting only that account and
  `BUILTIN\Administrators`, with inheritance on so the identity file is protected at
  creation rather than by a later fixup.
- Mirror the validation style of `scripts/check-systemd-units.sh` and
  `scripts/check-launchd-plists.sh` with an equivalent Windows check script.
- Any config the installer seeds must set `file_logging = true` and
  `stdout_logging = false`, with `log_file` under the role's state/log directory. A service
  has no console, so a stdout-only config yields a service that works correctly while
  appearing to emit nothing. See spec §6.3.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A standard non-admin user cannot read the installed identity file. Verify with
      `icacls` and by attempting a read as another account.
- [ ] The service starts and reaches steady state under the virtual account.
- [ ] Log output lands in the role's log file, and is not lost to a nonexistent console.
- [ ] Service runs with no user logged in and survives logoff.
- [ ] Uninstall removes the service and does not leave the account or ACLs behind.

# P1 tasks

## P1-001 — Prove real `mqtts://` signaling on Windows

### Goal
The Docker broker E2E is Linux-only, so real MQTT-over-TLS signaling has never run on
Windows. rumqttc and rustls are cross-platform and the risk is low, but it is unverified.

### Recommended implementation
Install mosquitto natively on Windows (chocolatey) and run a manual offer↔answer tunnel
against it, forwarding one port. This can precede the automated version in P2-003.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A Windows peer completes signaling against a real TLS broker and passes data.

---

## P1-002 — Windows shutdown lifecycle test

### Files
```text
crates/p2p-daemon/tests/                (new Windows-gated test)
```

### Goal
`process_signal_shutdown.rs` is `#![cfg(unix)]`, so Windows has zero coverage of daemon
shutdown. With RDP forwarded by an always-on service, "did the listener actually close"
stops being cosmetic.

### Recommended implementation
Mirror the unix test's assertions — exit code, terminal `Closed` status, no lingering
listeners — but drive it through `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` rather than a signal.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test is `#![cfg(windows)]` and runs in the `test-windows` CI job.
- [ ] Asserts the same truthfulness properties as the unix test.

## P1-003 — Android test-harness portability on a Windows host

### Files
```text
android/app/src/test/java/com/phillipchin/webrtctunnel/data/ForwardsConfigStoreTest.kt
android/app/src/test/java/com/phillipchin/webrtctunnel/data/ForwardsRepositoryTest.kt
android/app/src/test/java/com/phillipchin/webrtctunnel/data/ConfigRepositoryTest.kt

android/app/src/test/java/com/phillipchin/webrtctunnel/ProbeEvidenceShellContractTest.kt
```

### Goal
Eight Kotlin unit tests fail on a Windows host. All are test-harness defects, not app
defects.

Categories:
1. Six use `File.setReadable(false)` / `setWritable(false)` / `setReadOnly()` to simulate
   an unreadable file. These are no-ops on Windows — NTFS ACLs do not map to POSIX mode
   bits — so the error path under test never triggers.
2. One asserts `template.contains(filesDir.absolutePath)` while the production code
   correctly TOML-escapes the path.
3. One invokes bash with an unquoted Windows path, so `\U`-style sequences are stripped.

### Recommended implementation
Prefer injecting a failing filesystem abstraction over relying on OS permission
side-effects. Do **not** change app behavior to make these pass.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `./gradlew check` is green on a Windows host.
- [ ] Still green on Linux CI.
- [ ] No production Kotlin behavior changed.

---

## P1-004 — Validate the offer role on Windows

### Goal
Spec §1 requires both roles. Only the answer role is exercised by the initial deployment.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A Windows offer peer completes a tunnel against a non-Windows answer peer over a
      real broker and real network.

---

## P1-005 — Real-network ICE validation

### Goal
All WebRTC validation so far is loopback. NAT traversal and STUN behaviour on Windows are
unverified.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A tunnel is established between two hosts on different networks with a Windows peer
      at one end.

---

# P2 tasks

## P2-001 — Windows packaging

### Goal
An installable artifact, matching the intent of `packaging/debian` and `packaging/macos`.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Produces a signed-installable package that performs P0-008's account and ACL setup.
- [ ] A documented uninstall path.

---

## P2-002 — Add Windows to the release-artifacts matrix

### Files
```text
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Goal
`release-artifacts` currently builds `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` only.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tagged builds publish a Windows artifact.
- [ ] Archive format is appropriate for Windows (zip, not tar.gz).

---

## P2-003 — Windows-native broker E2E

### Goal
Replace the Docker dependency for Windows with a native mosquitto so the real-broker path
is covered in CI.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Equivalent coverage to `real_broker_tunnel.rs`, running in the `test-windows` job.

---

## P2-004 — Runtime DACL validation

### Goal
Defense in depth on top of P0-008's install-time ACL: verify at load time that no ACE
grants read access to anyone but the owner, SYSTEM, and Administrators, so
`ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS` can become `true` on Windows.

### DECISION REQUIRED
Unlike P0-007, this one probably does need a policy call. See P0-007's note for how
`unsafe_code = "forbid"` actually works — the question is only ever whether `unsafe` ends
up in *our* crate's source or macro expansion, never whether a dependency contains it.

Calling `GetNamedSecurityInfo` and walking the ACL directly through `windows-sys` is raw
FFI, which is unambiguously `unsafe` in `p2p-platform` and would be rejected. So this needs
one of:

1. a vetted safe wrapper crate that exposes DACL inspection without `unsafe` at the call
   site — investigate availability and maintenance status before committing;
2. a documented `p2p-platform` exception on the model of `p2p-mobile`; or
3. shelling out to `icacls` and parsing its output — no `unsafe`, but fragile and
   locale-sensitive, so treat as a last resort.

Record the decision here. Note this is genuinely optional: P0-008's install-time ACL is what
provides the actual protection, and this task only upgrades `ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS`
from advisory to verified.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS` is `true` on Windows.
- [ ] A deliberately world-readable identity file is rejected at load.
- [ ] The P0-005 startup warning is removed as no longer applicable.
