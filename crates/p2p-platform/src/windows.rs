//! Windows implementation of the platform seam.
//!
//! # Why the permission checks are not enforced here yet
//!
//! NTFS expresses "who can read this file" as a DACL -- an ordered list of
//! access-control entries keyed by SID -- not as POSIX mode bits. There is no
//! meaningful `mode & 0o077` to test, so the unix checks cannot be ported
//! directly; the equivalent is inspecting the file's DACL and proving no ACE
//! grants read access to anyone but the owner, SYSTEM, and Administrators.
//!
//! Doing that from Rust means calling `GetNamedSecurityInfo` and walking the
//! ACL through raw Win32 FFI, which requires `unsafe`. This workspace sets
//! `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, with `p2p-mobile`'s JNI boundary as the single
//! documented exception, so adding a second exception is a deliberate policy
//! decision rather than an implementation detail.
//!
//! The protection itself does not depend on that decision. Where the identity
//! file lives determines the actual risk:
//!
//! * Under `%USERPROFILE%`, the default ACL already restricts access to that
//!   user plus SYSTEM and Administrators -- roughly equivalent to `0600`.
//! * Under `%ProgramData%`, the default inherited ACL commonly grants
//!   `BUILTIN\Users` read access, which *would* expose a private key to every
//!   local user.
//!
//! The planned fix is to apply a restrictive DACL to the config directory once,
//! at service-install time, granting only the service's virtual account
//! (`NT SERVICE\p2ptunnel`) and Administrators. That needs no `unsafe` and no
//! runtime inspection. Runtime DACL *validation* would be defense in depth on
//! top of it.
//!
//! Until then [`ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS`] is `false`, so callers can say so
//! plainly instead of reporting a check that did not happen.
