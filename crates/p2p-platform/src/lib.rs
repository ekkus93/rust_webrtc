//! The operating-system seam for the tunnel.
//!
//! Everything in the rest of the workspace is portable logic: protocol framing,
//! crypto, config *schema* and validation rules, the WebRTC data plane. The
//! handful of things that genuinely differ per OS -- where a user's home
//! directory lives, and how "only I can read this private key" is expressed --
//! live here, behind one small interface with a per-OS implementation.
//!
//! Android is a unix and uses the unix implementation unchanged.
//!
//! Note on the security functions: [`ensure_private_file_permissions`] and
//! [`ensure_not_writable_by_others`] back the `security.refuse_world_readable_identity`
//! and `security.refuse_world_writable_paths` config knobs, which
//! `AppConfig::validate` refuses to let you disable. Not every platform can
//! enforce them; [`ENFORCES_FILE_PERMISSIONS`] says whether this one does, so
//! callers can be honest about it rather than silently reporting success.
